Sure! Here is an example of the run.bat file contents:

```
@echo off
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Save the above code in a file named "run.bat" in the same directory as your main.py and requirements.txt files. 

To run the program, just double-click on the run.bat file. It will automatically install the required dependencies using pip and then execute the main.py file.
